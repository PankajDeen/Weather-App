# Weather-App
Iâ€™m excited to share a new project Iâ€™ve been working on: a Weather Web Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, this app provides real-time weather updates including temperature, humidity, and conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Current Weather Data: Instantly view weather details based on your location.

User-Friendly Design: Clean and responsive interface for all devices.

API Integration: Fetches up-to-date information using the OpenWeatherMap API.
